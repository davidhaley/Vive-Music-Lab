#### My experience building this application

This was my final project for the mobile track in Udacity's VR Developer Nano-Degree. We had full autonomy to choose a specific company, industry, or technology, and show the user ways it could be affected by virtual reality. I chose the music industry, because I am musician, DJ and producer myself, and because I wanted to do this anyway.

The project was challenging because Google Cardboard and mobile VR requires finite optimization. I spent a lot of time adding more functionality than what I have in this final build, but the platform would not support it at a reasonable framerate.

I had a lot of fun building the booths, especially the sequencer and audio visualizer. The sequencer was challenging, and took quite a while to get right. The audio visualizer is something I have been wanting to create. Now that I have it working, I can use it in upcoming projects.

I fully intend to expand on this project in the high-immersion section of Udacity's VR Developer Nano-Degree. I have many ideas I want to see implemented, using the HTC Vive.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for checking out my project.

Best regards,

David Haley
