# Music Lab

##### This project is currently in development.

Music Lab is a virtual reality application for HTC Vive. Taking inspiration from Valve's The Lab, my goal is to learn by prototyping features, then run those features through user tests, while maintaining a quick iteration cycle. The results will be compiled and used to create a complete VR experience.
